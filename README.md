# agplugin-socials
After installing the plugin. You'll have a new menu in your admin page "AGPlugin". 
It will have 2 different parts "follow" (who link to your social page) and "share" (to share the page).

    follow: add the URL to your social media to activate it.
    share: select the social media where your visitors can share the page.

You just have to use the shortcode in your theme to display them:
- share shortcode is: [share-nav]
- follow shortcode is: [follow-nav]

Enjoy !
